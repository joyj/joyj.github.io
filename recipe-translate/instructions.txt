Paste recipe in text box.
Use ### at the start of a line if you want the translator to ignore it.
Use ===== to separate the ingredients from the instructions.

You can change the ingredients in the recipe to be ones that you'll actually
use. For example, change "1 cup 2% milk" to "1 cup soy milk" if you're making
that substitution.
